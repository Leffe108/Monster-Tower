# Story
In the Netherlands there is a town called Monster. It want to show how much better it is there compared to its neighbours. So they decide to build a tall tower. Your job is to build that tower.

# Controls
The game can be played using mouse (left button) or keyboard. It also has partial support for screen readers.

## Keyboard controls

(&#42;) Note: The build room cursor is a focusable element in the tab cycle, and the *build room* keys only function when the cursor has focus.

## Screen readers
I have tried to support screen readers, but I'm not a regular screen reader user myself. If you have ideas on how to improve it, please get in touch.
