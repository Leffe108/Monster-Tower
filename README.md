# Story
In the Netherlands there is a town called Monster. It want to show how much better it is there compared to its neighbours. So they decide to build a tall tower. Your job is to build that tower.

# Contorls
The game can be played using mouse (left button) or keyboard. It also has partial support for screen readers.

## Keyboard controls
Key        | Context    | Usage
-----------|------------|----------
Tab        | Any        | Moves focus around toobar buttons, window buttons and built rooms/stairs/etc.
Enter      | Any        | Activate focused button/link.
Arrow keys | Build&nbsp;room* | Moves the place where a new room would be built in the arrow direction. Hold Ctrl to move left/right one room width at the time or 5 floors up/down at the time.

Escape     | Build&nbsp;room* | Abort building more rooms of current room type.

(&#42;) Note: The build room cursor is a focusable element in the tab cycle, and the *build room* keys only function when the cursor has focus.

## Screen readers
I have tried to support screen readers, but I'm not a regular screen reader user myself. If you have ideas on how to improve it, please get in touch.
